In preparation for this workshop you can install the Docker Desktop CE on your computer:

* Desktop operating systems (Docker Engine & additional tools - CE)
    * [Mac OS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
    * [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
    * Servers (CE)
* Linux 
    * [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
    * [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/)
    * [CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/)
    * [Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/fedora/)
    
This will give you a fully functional Docker environment on your own computer that you can continue to use for your own purposes moving forward. If you aren't able to set up your own Docker environment (the Windows installation and setup is quite involved) we will also have a hosted platform that we will use for the workshop as well.
