    "## What is containerization? What are Containers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Containerization is the process of defining the software components required to run a *specific application*. In the context of a Docker-based containerization process this definition is written into a *Dockerfile*. A Dockerfile is then used to create a *Docker Image*. That Docker Image can then be used as the basis for one or more separate *Docker Containers*, or as the starting point for defining a new Dockerfile. Docker containers are immutable (i.e. changes to the container are **do not** update the source image, and are lost when the container is stopped *and* removed). A modified container can be used to create a new image through the *commit* command. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Docker flow diagram](dockerFlow.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of building a new image from a base image plus changes defined in a dockerfile, or changes made to a container based on that image and committed to a new image yields a model in which individual Docker images are made up of stacks of images that have been used to build previous base images. \n",

    "### How is it different from virtualization (i.e. virtual machines)?\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have encountered references to *virtual machines* (or VMs) as a model for running virtual computer environments within/on computer hardware. A common question that arises when discussing containerization is how it differs from virtualization.  The primary difference between the two is that the machine images and corresponding virtual machines that they enable are fully self-contained virtual systems that provide all of the core capabilities (in virtual form) of a dedicated computer, including a full operating system (such as Windows or Liunx [Mac OS is infrequently used as an OS for VMs]) and set of applications running within that operating system. Containerized apps, on the other hand share a common container engine that provides core operating system capabilities that allow the application code within the container to run *as if* it were operating within a fully functional OS and hardware environment. \n",
