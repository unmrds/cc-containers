    "## What is containerization? What are Containers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Containerization is the process of defining the software components required to run a *specific application*. In the context of a Docker-based containerization process this definition is written into a *Dockerfile*. \n",
    "\n",
    "A container is the executable software bundle that has been generated from a containerization process. In Docker the container is a *Docker Image*. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How is it different from virtualization (i.e. virtual machines)?\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have encountered references to *virtual machines* (or VMs) as a model for running virtual computer environments within/on computer hardware. A common question that arises when discussing containerization is how it differs from virtualization.  The primary difference between the two is that the machine images and corresponding virtual machines that they enable are fully self-contained virtual systems that provide all of the core capabilities (in virtual form) of a dedicated computer, including a full operating system (such as Windows or Liunx [Mac OS is infrequently used as an OS for VMs]) and set of applications running within that operating system. Containerized apps, on the other hand share a common container engine that provides core operating system capabilities that allow the application code within the container to run *as if* it were operating within a fully functional OS and hardware environment. \n",
